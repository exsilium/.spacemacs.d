# Synopsis #

[Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org) has changed the way people onboard and use [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/Emacs). The unique mnemonics key binding design has helped popularize `evil-mode` and allow for frictionless start. Still, some further fine-tuning of the configuration is needed and this repo is about keeping a consistent Spacemacs configuration that can be easily shared between different computers.
